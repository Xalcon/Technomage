## Weapons / Tools
Weapons and tools can have a focus mechanic which allows the player to build up energy on use,
which can then be discharged by using a tool/weapon specific ability.

Weapons created through amalgamation crafting will have a randomized name (but a static subtitle).

Stats for weapons and tools can be re-balanced in an endstone altar
