Just some random things i need to put somewhere

* Vitalism, The theory of life (Vitalogy?)
  * Artificial life? (Golems?)
  * Anima, the essence spirits are made of
* Ley
  * Arcane energy
  * No known way of creating
  * Can only be gathered from ley lines which extend through dimensions (invisible to the naked eye)
* Fel
  * Corrupted ley energy ?
  * Whats corrupting it?
  * What are the effects of the corruption?
  * (WoW Lore: Fel Magic describes the magic of sacrificing energy or drawing energy from other living beings)
* Void
  * Lack of any energy
  * Dimensions can become void when ley energy is extracted in too high amounts for the dimension to recover.
	Due to the shear size of a dimension, this process can take a long time for a single person, but whole
	civilizations may be able to devoid a dimension in years instead of millennia.
	Old tails say the **End** was once full of life and energy, but an ancient civilization used up all its
	energy. Some ancient texts even say **Enderman** are the remnants of the old civilization, although these
	texts never describe the ender dragons existance nor the endermans ability to teleport anywhere they like.
* Technonomicon
  * An ancient magical book that seem to be mostly empty
* Upgradable Weapon system with different traits, optimized for Technomage Mobs / Boss Encounters 
  * Massive damage increase towards technomage mobs to allow high health values
  * Average damage towards vanilla/modded entities so Technomage doesnt evolve into another powercreep mod

  * Technomage entities take reduced damage from weapons without technomage specific traits
