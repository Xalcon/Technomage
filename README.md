# Technomage
This project is a magic mod, inspired by other mods like Thaumcraft and games like World of Warcraft and (duuh) Technomage!

The mod isnt even in its pre-alpha state. Its more a collection of code snippets that are fused together with some not so sticky coding glue.
Therefore, contributions to this repository are nice, but I may not accept them.
